These 3 days were so insigntful and worth attending. I came to a lot of things and workings of Git and GitHub.
These sessions had helped me learn about git setup, git commands, github basic use and its application on code management.

Before the course I wanted to learn basics and woking mechanism of Git and Github, which I believe this session has addressed so well.
I really liked the way how the facilitator was carrying out these sessions including all types of learning background participants.

I look forward to participate in more advanced courses on Git and Github in the days to come and grow my code management skills.
GCA and Girls in STEAM are doing a lot of great sessions and programs with no cost to new learners and enthusiasts. I would like to thank
the entire team and wish for a successful endeavours ahead.
